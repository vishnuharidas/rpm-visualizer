# RPM Visualizer

Many years ago, when I was playing around and having fun with IoT devices and electric motors, I wanted to visualize how a particular RPM speed looked and felt, but I couldn't find a simple tool for this purpose. Now, even though there are web-based visualizers available today, I thought of creating one with GitHub Copilot just to give it a try. 

This interactive web application visualizes RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) using a rotating bar animation powered by pure CSS animations instead of Canvas and manual drawing approaches that other tools typically use. Perfect for educational purposes, demonstrations, or understanding rotational speed concepts.

## üéØ Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch a rotating bar spin at the exact RPM you set
- **Smooth Animation**: CSS-powered animations for seamless rotation
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Up/Down arrows for RPM adjustments.

## üöÄ Demo

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start using the RPM visualizer.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **‚Üë Arrow Up**: Increase RPM by 1
- **‚Üì Arrow Down**: Decrease RPM by 1
- **Spacebar**: Toggle between 0 and 1 RPM (start/stop)

## üéì Educational Uses

This visualizer is perfect for:
- **Physics Education**: Understanding rotational motion and angular velocity
